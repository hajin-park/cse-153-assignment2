# HOW TO LISTEN TO YOUR AI-GENERATED DRUMS

## Generated Files:
- `generated_drums.mid` - NEW drum beat created by your AI model
- `original_drums.mid` - Original drum pattern from training data
- `dance_video.mp4/.gif` - Visualization of the dance movements

## Listening Options:

### Option 1: Windows Media Player (Built-in)
1. Double-click the .mid files
2. Windows will play them with built-in MIDI sounds

### Option 2: Online MIDI Player (Best Quality)
1. Go to: https://onlinesequencer.net/import
2. Upload your .mid file
3. Click play to hear with high-quality instruments

### Option 3: Music Production Software
- **GarageBand** (Mac): Drag .mid file in, hear realistic drums
- **FL Studio** (Windows): Import MIDI, use built-in drum kits
- **Audacity** (Free): File → Import → MIDI

### Option 4: Browser-based Players
- **Chrome MIDI Player**: Search "chrome midi player extension"
- **Online Drum Machine**: https://drumbit.app (import MIDI)

## What You're Hearing:
- **Kick (36)**: Deep bass drum hits
- **Snare (38)**: Sharp snare hits  
- **Hi-hat (42)**: Metallic percussion
- **Toms (45,47,50)**: Mid-range drums
- **Crash/Ride (49,51)**: Cymbal sounds

## Model Performance:
Your AI model learned to generate drum patterns that respond to:
- Dance movement energy (faster moves → more drums)
- Beat timing (aligns with dance rhythm)
- Style patterns (different moves → different drum patterns)

Compare the generated vs original to see how well it learned!
