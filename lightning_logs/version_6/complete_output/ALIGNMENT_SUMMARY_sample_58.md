# CHOREO2GROOVE ALIGNMENT ANALYSIS REPORT
## Sample 58 - Generated on 2025-06-03 00:17:04

## 🎯 MAIN QUESTION: Are the drums aligned with the dance?

### 📊 CORRELATION ANALYSIS
- **AI Generated Drums ↔ Movement**: -0.002
- **Original Drums ↔ Movement**: 0.089
- **Difference**: -0.091

### 🔍 WHAT THIS MEANS:
- **Correlation > 0.3**: Strong alignment (drums follow dance energy)
- **Correlation 0.1-0.3**: Moderate alignment (some relationship)
- **Correlation < 0.1**: Weak alignment (mostly random)

**Your AI's Performance**: Weak
**Compared to Original**: Worse

### 🥁 DRUM PATTERN ANALYSIS
```
                    AI Generated  │  Original
Drum Events:             133      │        40
Kick Hits:                 0      │         0
Snare Hits:              132      │        40
Total Accents:           132      │        40
```

### 🎬 HOW TO VERIFY ALIGNMENT:

1. **Listen + Watch Together**:
   - Play `generated_drums.mid` 
   - Watch `dance_video_FIXED.gif`
   - Notice: Do drum hits match energetic movements?

2. **Look for Patterns**:
   - **Big movements** → Should trigger kick/snare
   - **Fast movements** → Should trigger hi-hats
   - **Pauses** → Should have fewer drum hits

3. **Compare to Random**:
   - Original correlation: 0.089
   - If AI correlation > 0.1, it's learning patterns
   - If AI correlation > original, it's working well!

### ✅ EVIDENCE OF ALIGNMENT:
- ⚠️ WEAK: Low correlation suggests more training needed
- ✅ Generated 133 drum events (not silent)
- ✅ Used 132 accent hits (kicks/snares)

### 🎵 NEXT STEPS:
1. Open `alignment_analysis_sample_58.png` to see visual proof
2. Play the MIDI files while watching the GIF
3. Look for drum hits during high-energy dance moments
4. Compare AI vs Original patterns

**Bottom Line**: Weak alignment detected!
Your AI may be learning dance-to-drum relationships.
